Treated with 150 ml water and the resulting yellow solid filtered off and
washed with water. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum over phosphorous

_ _ This material was crystallised from acetonitrile; dissolved up in ~1 litre
boiling acetonitrile and the cloudy solution filtered hot through a fluted
paper. Crystallisation of product from the filtrate was eventually achieved,
with difficulty, by rapid cooling in drikold/acetone and seeding/scratching as
it warmed up. Cooled in ice/water then the solid was collected by filtration
and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum
at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 6.03 g creamy-white
solid [B].

Material B was combined with the same product from P14-A and this total of
7.32 g recrystallised from the minimum of acetonitrile (~550 ml) with hot
filtration again to remove trace insoluble matter. Cooled in ice/water and
seeded/scratched to induce crystallisation then stood in the fridge overnight.
The solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile.
Dried by desiccation under high vacuum initially at room temperature, then at
60°C, to constant weight. This afforded 5.04 g creamy-white solid [C].

LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 371.06 and MH- = 369.08 at 1.85

Unfortunately nmr showed entrapped acetonitrile at an unacceptable level (~0.5
equiv.). To remove this material C was stirred in ~100 ml ether for an hour,
recollected and washed with ether. Dried at 60°C as before to constant weight.

material left.

Vessel 5: 2 eq of aniline (0.018 ml), 4eq NaOtBu (38 mg) --> LC/MS showed
after 1.5 h as well as after 20 h no formation of the desired product, but
starting material

Vessel 6: 5 eq of aniline (0.046 ml), 5eq NaOtBu (48 mg) --> LC/MS showed
after 1.5 h about 14% of the starting material. Some undesired side products
as well as a lot of starting material was detected. After 20 h less starting
material, approximately the same amount of desired prod. and more of the
undesired side products were obtained.

In conclusion the best result could be reached utilizing 1.5 eq of sodium
tert-butoxide and 5 eq. aniline. Increasing of the amount of NaOtBu did not
change the result according to a higher yield, but gave another unidentified
side product. This side product developed faster, when at the same time an
increased amount of aniline and NaOtBu was used.

then added last. Placed test tube onto Smith MW* platform. Heated reaction to
130°C for 4 minutes. Reaction know has a heavy black ppt present. Took LCMS -
there is some product (~15%) beginning to form. Placed sealed test tube in
heated (130°C) oil bath overnight. Took LCMS - all SM is consumed with a
moderate product peak in evidence. Transferred reaction to separatory funnel.
Partitioned reaction with EtOAc (40 ml) and water (25 ml). Separated off aq
layer. Washed with sat NaCl. The organic was dried MgSO4, filt and conc - pale
yellow syrup, 02915-84-0. Dissolved sample in 100% MeOH, added 2 drops NH4OH
to adjust pH of sample and filtered off insolubles. The residue was purified
via Agilent prep HPLC: Gradient run of 20-95% MeOH/H2O with 10 mmol NH4CO3
buffer (pH 10) over 25 mins. Flow rate 40 ml/min at wavelength 220 nM
collection. 250 X 21.2 mm Gemini Axia pakC18 10 micron column. Collected like

desired product to this isomeric product being circa 5:1. LCMS also shows that
a small amount of the 2-aminooxazole ester starting material remains (Rt= 0.99

slightly longer reaction times, maybe 90 mins. A small amount of the coupled

LCMS showed the desired product to be present along with what is possibly some
2,4-dichloropyridine starting material (Rt=1.74 min). The conditions developed

Conclusion: The required product was formed based on LCMS of the crude
reaction mixture but the product was not isolated.

silica, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water with basic modifier (1%
ammonium hydroxide). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford
N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (22.00 mg, 11.10 %) as a pale yellow
residue.

The product isolated, although impure, looks like the required product based
on LCMS. The 1H NMR of the purified material is in D6-DMSO here and so not
directly comparable with previous spectra in CDCl3.

Conclusion: This may be worth pursuing (i.e. adding DMSO to aid solubility)
based on the slightly increased yield.

**Revision: Required product not isolated, spectral analysis of isolated
sample does not match those of authentic samples of the coupled product**

atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to
140 °C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The crude product was purified by reverse-phase flash chromatography, elution
gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to
afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-4-carboxylate (99 mg, 37.0
%) as a pale yellow solid.

Conclusion: Yield produced under microwave conditions is essentially identical
to overnight reaction with conventional heating. Therefore screening of other
aminooxazoles can be carried out under microwave conditions in the interest of
time.

heated to 140 °C for 20 minutes in the microwave reactor and cooled to RT.

It was seen that the NaOtBu had been ommitted. This was added and reintroduced
for heating at 150 oc for 20 mins. The reaction was reintroduced to the
microwave and heated at 150 °C for a further 15 minutes.

(9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) - Xantphos (0.029 g,
0.05 mmol) and cesium carbonate (0.387 g, 1.19 mmol) were mixed in toluene
(5ml), purged with nitrogen and stirred in a sealed tube at 90 °C overnight.

LCMS: pH = 3, 2 minute run time, shows sign of product at Rt = 1.41 min

The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (20 ml), filtered through a celite
pad and concentrated to give 477 mg yellow solid.

TLC (1:1 - EtOAc : n-heptane) see diagram UV only

This was disolved in DCM, absorbed onto a samplet and purified on a 10 g
Biotage SNAP column (approx column volume = 7 ml), eluting with a step-wise
gradient from 0 : 10 to 4 : 6 EtOAc : n-heptane using a Thomson pump
collecting 12 ml fractions.

F1 - y = 149 mg - GCMS (Steep_10 min), Rt = 7.88 min (100%) m/z: 346/8.

Twenty hours later, LCMS showed 23% of the precursor @ 0.98 min (no mass
ionization) left on a 2-min basic run. GCMS showed no precursor and 94% of an
unknown @ 6.90 min (whihc might be the desired product but not ionizable) on a
10-min run.

The reaction was cooled to RT. The crude mixture was concentrated to givr a
dark-brown gum. The dark-brown gum was dissolved in EtOAc, washed with water,
and evaporated to give a brown solid. The brown solid was passed through a 20
g SiO2 flash column eluting with EtOAc, collected all of the eluent, and then
evaporated to give a brown solid as the crude. The crude would be used in
EN08121-56 without purification, assuming 100% yield.

**_September 11 2015_**

LCMS showed no precursor and 37% of the desired mass MH+ 257/259 @ 0.86 min
along with lots of unknowns on a 2-min basic run.

The reaction was cooled to RT, and filtered off the solid (Cs2CO3). The filter
was concentrated, re-dissolved in EtOAc, washed with waster, dried through
MgSO4, and evaporated to give an orange gum.

**_September 14 2015_**

The orange gum was added to a Biotage column and was eluted with 10-100%EtOAc
in Heptane. Collected fractions.

The column was stuck as 37% EtOAc in Heptane. A lot of CH2Cl2 was pushed
through the column manually, and then continued the elution with 0-100% EtOAc
in DCM. Collected fractions.

The product fractions were identified, combined based on LCMS and TLC, and
evaporated to give a white solid as the desired product (EN07946-27-001).
Based on LCMS, it was 98% pure; based on NMR in DMSO, it was > 95%pure;
_however, based on NMR in CDCl3, there were ~30% impurity in the aromatic
proton region._  The product was used for next step without further

allowed to stir at room temperature for 10 minutes before being placed in an
oil bath preheated to 100 °C.

After heating overnight, LC-MS indicated complete conversion of the aryl
bromide to the expected mass. The reaction was allowed to cool and was diluted
with water and CH2Cl2. The biphasic mixture was suction-filteerd to remove
insoluble materials, and the filtrate layers were separated. The aqueous layer
was extracted with CH2Cl2, and the combined organics were washed with brine,
dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
resulting crude solid was recrystallized from hot EtOAc/EtOH.

A first crop of 2.37 g was collected. Trituration of the evaporated mother
liquor with EtOAc afforded an additional 634 mg of solid.
