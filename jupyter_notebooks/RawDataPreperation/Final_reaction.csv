with N2 (3x), and then anhydrous dioxane (40 mL) was added. The mixture was
allowed to stir at room temperature for ~5 minutes and was then heated under
N2 in a 100 ������C oil bath.

After heating overnight, LC-MS showed complete conversion of the starting
material to the desired product (trace N-phenylated product). A significant
side product appeared to be present, derived from the starting
aminoquinazoline that had undergone two Suzuki couplings in the previous step
(see EN01547-76; MW=518.6). The reaction was allowed to cool and was
partitioned between EtOAc and H2O. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc,
and the combined organics were concentratepressure. The crude
material was purified by silica gel chromatography (Rf in EtOAc = 0.44) to
give a yellow-orange solid.

2.92 g (51%) of solid was collected. A trace of EtOAc remained by NMR analysis
despite being kept under high vacuum over the weekend.

10:10:32: The mixture was transfered to a mixture consisting of 700 mM acetate
buffer pH=2 (12.5 mL/g-bulk-LR; 12.5 mL) and isopropyl acetate (6.2 mL/g-bulk-
LR; 6.2 mL) to give pH=5.65. To the mixture was added 4 M aqueous sulfuric
acid (1.77 mL/g-bulk-LR; 1.77 mL) to give pH=2. The mixture was stirred for 15
minutes. The phases were separated and analyzed by means of HPLC-UV

12:32:57: To the water phase was added dichloromethane (10 mL/g-bulk-LR; 10
mL). The mixture was stirred and 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mL) was
added to give pH=12. The phases were separated and analyzed by means of HPLC-
UV. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to give yellow
oil. The crude product was purified by means of column chromatography (40 g
SiO2; 4 % MeOH, 1 NH3 in MeOH in DCM; Rf=0.2). Yellow solid was obtained (250

Reaction was allowed to stir for 1.5 hours at which point LC/MS was taken
which indicated that all the dibromopyridine had been consumed. Reaction was
quenched by addition of excess ammonium chloride.

Mixture was filtered though a plug of celite, extracted with ethyl acetate.
The organic fractions were collected and washed with water, then dried over
NaSO4, rotovapped down to an oil, redissolved in DCM then purified over a 120g
column using 5 minutes of pure hexane, followed by a 0-50% EtOAc gradient
(product comes off at around 35%). The relevant fractions were collected and
rotovapped down yielding the product as an oil.

Note: a further 34 mg of impure product came off the column early and so the
yield for this reaction is probably closer to 35% had the purification been
efficient.

Conclusion: Somewhat surprisingly the methyl substituted amino-oxazole gave
significant amounts of coupled product. It appears that certain moderately
elctron rich substrates may also undergo relatively efficient coupling.

An activated catalyst solution was prepared by adding
TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (61.3 mg, 0.07 mmol) and
(9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (77 mg, 0.13 mmol)
to an oven-dried microwave vial. The vial was then capped, purged with
nitrogen and anisole (1 mL) (degassed) was added. The solution was stirred at

To another oven-dried microwave vial was added potassium carbonate (126 mg,
0.91 mmol), ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (190 mg, 1.22 mmol) and
2,4-dichloropyridine (90 mg, 0.61 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged
with nitrogen. anisole (1.6 mL) and the activated catalyst solution (0.45 mL
of Soln. 1 from above) were added (this corresponds to a catalyst loading of
10% Pd). The vessel was then heated to 120������C for 16 h.ed none of the desired product to be present. Some
of the amine starting material appears to be present and none of the
2,4-dichloropyridine remains. The mass for the double addition product
(addition at the 2- and 4-positions) is present, but co-elutes with the
reaction solvent anisole and is not quantifiable as a result.

Conclusion: This is a somewhat surprising result, based on the fact that the
previous reaction (EN05378-17) results in the formation of significant coupled
product. These reaction conditions are apparently not suitable for the
coupling of the ester substituted 2-aminooxazole.

DCM (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2
g). The solvent was then removed from the reaction mixture under reduced
pressure. The resulting residue was then added tom a dry-load tube prior to
chromatography.

The crude product was purified by flashgradient 0 to 2.5% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. The desired product
(4-substitution) was isolated as a mixture with the 2-substituted product. The
ratio of the 2-isomer to the 4-isomer is 2.4:1 for the mxture with no other
fractions containing either isomer.

Conclusion: The apparent higher selectivity for the 4-isomer is due to the
overlap of the 2,4-dichloropyridine starting material with this isomer.
Therefore this reaction actually forms the 2-isomer selectively and is not a
very active catalyst for this transformation.

purge cycles (vac-nitrogen). Dioxane was then added to this mixture via
syringe, followed by the Pd(OAc)2 in a single portion and the vessel was
heated for the required time as above. Solvent boiled dry from reaction
overnight. Only DMSO remained. **Crude proton NMR shows mainly dichlorpyridine

The product isolated, although impure, looks like the required product based
on LCMS. The 1H NMR of the purified material is in D6-DMSO here and so not
directly comparable with previous spectra in CDCl3.

Conclusion: This may be worth pursuing (i.e. adding DMSO to aid solubility)
based on the slightly increased yield.

**Revision: Required product not isolated, spectral analysis of isolated

tert-butoxide (2.333 mL, 19.06 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture
followed by another amount of pre-formed catalyst using
Bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (0.274 g, 0.51 mmol) was added in one
portion ttoluene (5 mL) as
above. The mixture was heated at 60������C for 7 hours then further catalyst added

one portion to Palladium(II) acetate (0.057 g, 0.25 mmol) in toluene (5 mL) as
above. The mixture was stirred at 60������C for 18 hours. Work up was by diluting
with water (30 ml) and DCM (100 ml) then filtering through a pad of celite and
washing through well with DCM (6 x 50 ml). The organic layer was dried over
Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was
purified by flash silica chromatography (330g column), elution gradient 0 to
100% EtOAc in heptane (material applied in DCM). Pure fractions were
evaporated to dryness to leave a yellow solid, EN05005-04-01. The solid was
triturated with Et2O (20 ml) and the solid filtered off and washed with Et2O

15:50; Another 0.4 ml amine was added to the mixture.

16:15; No further progress by HPLC, reaction terminated. 50 microlitres of the
mixture was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in methanol-d4 and 1H NMR

an isolated yield of ~ 20% of the desired product, due to the fact that this

The product fractions were identified,on LCMS and TLC, and
evaporated to give a white solid as the desired product (EN07946-27-001).
Based on LCMS, it was 98% pure; based on NMR in DMSO, it was > 95%pure;
_however, based on NMR in CDCl3, there were ~30% impurity in the aromatic

2\. The reaction was heated at 90������C in oil-bath for 4 hr. LCMS showed partial
formation of product. Heated overnight at 90������C.

3\. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite pad and the filtrate was
loaded onto column and run chromotography to purify (10% MeOH in DCM), semi-
pure product was obtained and the sample was submitted to analytical group for
further purification.

4\. 10 mg pure product was obtained.
